RingBuffer version 0.04
=======================

This PERL module provides the abstract ability to implement a Ring Buffer.
You can set the size of the ring and you can also set the type of object
that the ring 'holds'.

I implemented this because I needed a PERL version of the ring buffer that
I was using in my Atmel programming.  It is designed to be easily translated
to C.
